Hello there 👋, I recently graduated from Seattle University with a B.S. in **Computer Science** 👨‍💻. During summer 2023, I interned with **Walmart** on their Global Marketplace team and built microservices using **Spring Boot**. I am especially interested in designing applications with an emphasis on accessibility. In my free time, you can find me at a concert, the gym, or enjoying a good book.
